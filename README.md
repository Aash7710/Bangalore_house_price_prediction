# Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore based on features like area (square feet), number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, balconies, and location. It uses machine learning techniques to estimate the price of a house given user inputs.

## Project Overview

In the competitive real estate market of Bangalore, predicting the price of homes accurately is a key advantage for both buyers and sellers. This web-based application allows users to input essential details such as the number of BHKs, bathrooms, balcony count, and location, and provides an estimated price for the home.

### Main Features:
- Enter area in square feet, number of BHKs, bathrooms, balconies, and select location.
- Fetches the house price prediction from a backend machine learning model.
- Real-time updates of available location options from the server.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Easy-to-use front-end for users to input home details and view predicted prices.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: The app interacts with a Flask-based backend to provide real-time house price predictions.
- **Location-Based Prediction**: The house price estimation takes into account the location, which is a crucial factor in Bangalore's real estate market.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with jQuery)
  - Bootstrap for responsive design
  - FontAwesome for icons
  
- **Backend**: 
  - Flask for API development and handling requests
  - Python with machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)

- **Machine Learning Model**: 
  - A trained regression model for price prediction based on historical data.
  
- **Libraries**:
  - Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn for data processing and model building.
  - Tesseract OCR (for additional image extraction if needed).
  
- **Deployment**: Flask server (local or cloud-based).

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Aash7710/Bangalore_house_price_prediction.git
cd Bangalore_house_price_prediction
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the required dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Train the Model

Train the machine learning model and save it to a `.pkl` file. This is required for serving predictions via the Flask API.

### Step 4: Set Up Environment

Ensure you have a trained model stored in the correct path and that the Flask app is set up to load the model correctly.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Start the Flask Server

Run the Flask development server by executing:

```
python app.py
```

This will start the server locally on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Step 2: Access the Web Interface

Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the home price prediction app.

## API Endpoints

### 1. **Predict Home Price**
- **URL**: `/predict_home_price`
- **Method**: POST
- **Parameters**:
  - `total_sqft` (float): Total area of the house in square feet
  - `bhk` (int): Number of BHKs
  - `bath` (int): Number of bathrooms
  - `balcony` (int): Number of balconies
  - `location` (string): Location of the house
- **Response**: Estimated price in Lakhs

### 2. **Get Location Names**
- **URL**: `/get_location_names`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: List of available locations for predictions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Location-based insights**: Provide detailed insights about each location such as average price, market trends, etc.
- **Advanced UI**: Improve the user interface with more real-time feedback and better visualizations.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the app on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku for wider accessibility.
